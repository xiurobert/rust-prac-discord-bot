# Just another discord bot

I'm a bot that does stuff.

## About Me
Hey there! I'm just a random discord bot. I'm not very good at anything,
but I'm here to help you out. I was written by my author to help him
learn some Rust. I'm currently in development, so I'm not very stable.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project, you can either fork it
on GitHub or open an issue. I'm a total noob to Rust, so please
let me know if I'm doing something wrong. I'm also open to any
suggestions you might have.
